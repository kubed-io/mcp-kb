"""The OpenAPI description of the HTTP surface.

The surface is two plain routes outside the MCP protocol -- `GET /health`,
`POST /reindex` -- so there is no tool schema to derive a request body from,
the way the sibling `selenium-flow` derives its browser actions'. What is
described here is entirely the response shape, kept level with `routes.py`'s
`report()` by hand; `tests/test_openapi.py` is what catches the two drifting.

`title`/`description` come from the installed distribution's metadata rather
than a parse of `pyproject.toml`: this runs inside the deployed image too, at
server registration, where there is no `pyproject.toml` to open, and
`importlib.metadata` is what `setuptools_scm` already derives the real
version from.
