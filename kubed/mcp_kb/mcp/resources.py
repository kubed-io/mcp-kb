"""The catalogue, served as MCP resources.

MCP already has a primitive for "material an agent reads", and it is the
resource, not the tool. So this is the real interface and ``tools.py`` is a
mirror of it, kept for the clients -- n8n above all -- to which a resource-only
server looks empty.

One provider serves the whole address space rather than one provider per skill.
FastMCP's ``SkillsDirectoryProvider`` is the obvious alternative and was what
this server used; it is wrong here for two reasons that only show up at scale:

- It names a skill after its folder, so two packs shipping a ``testing/`` become
  one, and the loser is not merely shadowed but absent from the server. With
  four packs and ninety skills that is a matter of time, not luck.
- It lists every skill and every manifest on every ``resources/list`` -- 77KB
  for this catalogue, paid by every client on every listing. That is the same
  expense this server rejects ``ResourcesAsTools`` for.

``Catalogue`` fixes both by listing *indexes* and resolving content on demand,
which is the resource half of progressive disclosure. It would be cleaner still
as a directory tree, but MCP's ``resources/directory/read`` has no
implementation in FastMCP 4.0.3, so a dozen index URIs are the closest thing
available.

    An out-of-scope URI resolves to None, which FastMCP reports as an unknown
    resource. That conflation is deliberate and matches ``SkillIndex``: a scoped
    client must not be able to confirm another pack's contents from the shape of
    an error.

    the model has to pick one.

    Filtering the listing rather than registering conditionally is what keeps
    one server object correct for every client at once. The decision depends on
    who is asking, so it can only be made per request; registration happens once
    at boot, when there is no asker.
