"""Prompts: templates a client offers its *user*, served from markdown files.

A skill is read by the model when it decides to. A prompt is picked by a person
-- Claude Code lists them as slash commands -- who fills in a few arguments
before the model sees anything. Different primitive, so a different module, but
scoped by the same pack (the library) and ``X-Skill-Pack`` rules as skills:
``harvest.py`` finds the files per source, and this module turns them into
prompts joined to that source's library.

A file is YAML frontmatter plus a body::

    ---
    description: One line for the prompt picker.
    arguments:
    - name: app
      description: Shown to whoever fills it in.
      required: true
    - name: since
      default: 1h
    ---
    Investigate {{ app }} over the last {{ since }}.

Placeholders are ``{{ name }}`` rather than ``str.format``'s ``{name}`` because
these bodies are full of LogQL, PromQL and JSON, which all use single braces.

The exposed name is ``<pack>_<file stem>``. Prompt names are one flat namespace
per server, and two packs shipping a ``debug.md`` must not collide the way two
skills named ``testing`` used to.
