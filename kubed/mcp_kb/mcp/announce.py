    MCP has no "the server changed" broadcast a stateless HTTP deployment can
    rely on, so this rides the next request the client makes anyway: compare the
    generation it was last told about against the live one, and if they differ,
    send the two list-changed notifications before answering.

    Once per move, per session, which is what the stored state buys. Sending on
    every request would have every client re-listing constantly; sending only on
    a listing would leave a client that never lists again holding stale URIs.

    A session's first request stores the current generation without announcing
    anything -- it has nothing stale to discard.

    Which leaves the connections that cannot remember. MCP 2026-07-28 dropped
    sessions, and FastMCP 4.0.3 serves such a connection by minting a fresh
    session id per request: ``set_state`` there writes an entry nobody will
    ever read, one per request, into a store with a day-long TTL. So an HTTP
    request arriving without an ``mcp-session-id`` is left alone entirely --
    correct as well as cheap, since a client with no session across requests
    has no listing to invalidate. stdio and in-memory connections have no such
    header to check at all, so ``_can_remember`` defaults to True for them and
    they fall through to the state calls too -- which, under FastMCP 4.0.3,
    turn out to be just as wasted, since those transports mint a fresh state
    key per request as well. Wasted, not wrong: the calls are still guarded,
    so this must never turn a working request into a failed one.

    trying: False.

    Anything that is not an HTTP request -- stdio, in-memory -- has no such

    continuous session either -- ``test_a_sessionless_connection_is_told_...``
