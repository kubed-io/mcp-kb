"""What slice of the catalogue a request may see.

A ``library`` is one choice and gives that whole library -- or, named by one of
its groups, that group. ``tags`` cut across libraries: anything carrying *any*
of them. Given both, the tags narrow within the library.

Every listing and every read takes a ``Scope`` and has to decide about it; an
empty one admits everything, and is falsy so ``if scope:`` reads as "is this
request narrowed at all".
