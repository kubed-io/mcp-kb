"""The skill catalogue: reading skills off disk and querying them.

Pure domain logic -- nothing here imports FastMCP or knows what MCP is.
``uris.py`` wraps this into the ``skill://`` address space that both halves of
the server project, which keeps the scoping rules in one testable place instead
of repeated in every handler.

``harvest.py`` decides *which* directories and files belong to the catalogue --
that is where the include globs, the dotfile rules and the skill-root
conventions live. This module only turns what harvest already found into
``Skill`` records and a place to read pack-level files from; it never walks a
tree on its own.

    places. Those files are not skills and must never be listed as one, but

    So they get their own addressable space, keyed by pack. A pack can be fed by

    globs, not "anything under the root that isn't inside a skill directory" --
    a source that only asked for ``shared/**`` must not let a client read
    ``README.md`` or ``.env`` by guessing its path.
