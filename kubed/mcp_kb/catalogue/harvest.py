"""Turn a source directory into the things the catalogue serves.

A source is a directory (``sources/`` produced it); what to serve out of it is
a set of globs per kind, and the conventions below are the defaults. Setting a
kind *replaces* its default rather than appending to it -- an append would
leave no way to stop serving a convention -- and an empty list turns a kind
off.

Everything found is resolved and checked to lie inside the root, the same
guard ``uris.py`` applies on read, so a glob like ``../**`` finds nothing.
Dot directories are skipped, except the three that agent tooling conventionally
lives in.

``dir/**`` and ``dir/**/*`` mean the same thing here: ``patterns`` normalises
the first into the second, because a trailing ``**`` matches directories only
before Python 3.13 and a config should not depend on which interpreter is
running it.
