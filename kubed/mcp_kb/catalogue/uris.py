"""The ``skill://`` address space, and the catalogue that answers it.

Everything this server serves has one address. A pack index, a skill's
instructions, a file a skill references, a file the *pack* references -- each is
a ``skill://`` URI, and reading one is the only operation there is.

That is not a stylistic choice. MCP already has a read-a-thing primitive, and a
model already knows how to drive it: list the resources, read a URI. A server
that invents ``read_skill(skill, file)`` alongside it is asking the model to
learn a second vocabulary for the same act. So the catalogue below is written
once, in URIs, and both halves of the protocol are thin projections of it --
``resources.py`` serves it as resources, ``tools.py`` as two tools with the same
shape for clients that have no resources.

The grammar, which is the whole API::

    skill://<selector>                 an index: a pack, or one of its groups
    skill://<pack>/<skill>             that skill's instructions (SKILL.md)
    skill://<pack>/<skill>/SKILL.md    the same thing, said in full
    skill://<pack>/<skill>/_manifest   what else that skill ships
    skill://<pack>/<skill>/<path>      one of those files
    skill://<pack>/_files              what the pack ships outside its skills
    skill://<pack>/<path>              one of those

One segment is an index, two or more is content: that is the only rule needed to
tell them apart, and it is why the group indexes live in the pack's own
namespace (``skill://grafana-lgtm``) rather than under it. ``selector`` accepts a
pack or a group for the same reason: an agent narrowing to ``grafana-lgtm``
should not first have to learn that it lives in ``grafana``.

Pack-qualified, unlike the URIs FastMCP's ``SkillsDirectoryProvider`` mints.
Those are keyed on the folder name alone, so two packs shipping a ``testing/``
silently collapse into one and the loser disappears from the server entirely.
The qualification costs a path segment and buys a namespace that cannot collide.
It also stays compatible with ``fastmcp.utilities.skills``, which reads
everything before the trailing ``/SKILL.md`` as the name and never assumes that
name has one segment.

Nothing here imports FastMCP. Absent content is ``None``, never an exception, so
a caller in the resource half can raise and a caller in the tool half can
explain -- and the scoping rule stays in one place either way.
