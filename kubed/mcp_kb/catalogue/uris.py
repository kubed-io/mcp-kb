"""The ``skill://`` address space, and the catalogue that answers it.

Everything this server serves has one address. A library index, a skill's
instructions, a file a skill references, a file the *library* references --
each is a ``skill://`` URI, and reading one is the only operation there is.

That is not a stylistic choice. MCP already has a read-a-thing primitive, and a
model already knows how to drive it: list the resources, read a URI. A server
that invents ``read_skill(skill, file)`` alongside it is asking the model to
learn a second vocabulary for the same act. So the catalogue below is written
once, in URIs, and both halves of the protocol are thin projections of it --
``resources.py`` serves it as resources, ``tools.py`` as two tools with the same
shape for clients that have no resources.

The grammar follows the MCP Skills extension (SEP-2640), which is the whole
API::

    skill://<library>/<folder>/<name>/SKILL.md    a skill's instructions
    skill://<library>/<folder>/<name>/_manifest   what else that skill ships
    skill://<library>/<folder>/<name>/<file>      one of those files
    skill://<library>/_index.md                   the folders and skills in a library
    skill://<library>/<folder>/_index.md          the folders and skills in a folder
    skill://<library>/_files.md                   files outside every skill
    skill://<library>/<file>                      one of those

``<folder>`` is the skill's directory below its plugin's skill root, and may
be empty or several segments deep; the last segment before the file is always
the skill's name. A skill is found by the longest prefix of the path that
names one, so a nested skill wins over the skill whose directory holds it.

An index lists what is *directly* under it: each folder as its own
``_index.md``, with how many skills are below it, and each skill in no deeper
folder as its ``SKILL.md``. A library of fifty skills in seven folders is then
seven lines, and the reader chooses which one to open, rather than paying for
every skill's description to find the folder it wanted.

Every other address is a directory -- a library, a folder, a skill's root --
and serves nothing, as on any other skill server. ``hint`` says which file to
read instead, for the error a caller sees.

Nothing here imports FastMCP. Absent content is ``None``, never an exception, so
a caller in the resource half can raise and a caller in the tool half can
explain -- and the scoping rule stays in one place either way.

        None covers absent, malformed, out-of-scope and directory addresses
        alike, and that conflation is deliberate: knowing a skill's exact
        address must not be enough to confirm it exists in a library the caller
        was not given.

        A skill is tried first, then the indexes, then the library's own files.
        The order never arbitrates between two things at one address, because
        the snapshot serves no such pair: a library file inside a skill of its
        own plugin, or named like an index, is skipped, and one inside another
        plugin's skill fails that plugin.

        Either kind of miss falls back to the plugin root -- the skill's own,
        then every one the library has -- because that is where a kit's shared
        material actually sits and what its citations and
        ``${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`` point at. The fallback reads what it is asked
