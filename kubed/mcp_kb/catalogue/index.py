"""The on-disk index: what each source yielded, without re-harvesting it.

Cold start reads this file and reconstructs every ``Skill`` and ``FilePrompt``
straight from it, with no filesystem walk and no frontmatter parse -- that is
the whole point of writing one. A row is therefore self-contained: absolute
paths as strings, tags sorted so two harvests of the same tree serialise
identically, and no reference back to a live object.

``Index`` is a frozen dataclass whose one field, ``sources``, is a plain
``dict``. Python does not stop a caller from mutating a dict reached through a
frozen instance; nothing here needs it to. The type is immutable by
convention, matching every other snapshot in this codebase, and callers that
build a new ``Index`` build a new ``sources`` mapping rather than mutating one
in place.

``config_hash`` and the ``version`` field are cold start's two questions before
it trusts anything in the file: "was this built from the config I have now",
and "do I still know how to read this shape". Either mismatch means rebuild
from scratch, so ``Index.read`` folds every way of failing those questions --
missing file, unparsable JSON, a wrong or absent version, a shape that does
not match the dataclasses below -- into a single ``None``.
