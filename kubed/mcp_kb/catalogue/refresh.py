"""The refresh policy: when a source is looked at again, and what the answer is worth.

``KnowledgeBase`` owns the transaction -- the lock, the records, the one
assignment that swaps the snapshot -- and this module owns the decisions it
makes along the way: which sources are due, whether one has moved since its
record was built, whether a failed rebuild is worth serving over the harvest
already on disk, and whether the result counts as a change at all.

The background loop lives here too, because all it does per tick is apply that
policy; what to do with what it finds is still the server's. It drives the
knowledge base through the same public surface ``routes.py`` uses, so nothing
here reaches into how a snapshot is built or stored.
