"""The MCP server itself: wiring, and the lifecycle of what it serves.

Assembles a FastMCP instance from the catalogue a config file describes -- the
address space, the resources, the mirror tools, the routes -- and runs it on a
transport. Turning a fetch into a directory is ``sources``'s job; resolving
the config's plugins and reading a marketplace is ``plugins``'s; deciding what
in a plugin counts as a skill, a prompt or a library-level file is
``catalogue/harvest.py``'s; building one immutable view of all of it is
``catalogue/snapshot.py``'s; the catalogue itself lives in
``catalogue/skills.py``, ``catalogue/prompts/`` and ``catalogue/uris.py``; and
deciding when a fetch is looked at again is ``catalogue/refresh.py``'s. This
module runs the resolution phases in order, connects the pieces, and owns the
one mutable thing in the process: which ``Snapshot`` is current.

Three rules follow from that, and every change here has to keep them:

- **Start from the index, not from the sources.** ``<cache>/index.json`` holds
  what each fetch and each plugin yielded last time. If it was built from this
  same config, boot reuses every record whose tree is still on disk and
  rebuilds only the rest. A pod restart is then milliseconds and touches no
  network, and the question "has anything changed?" is deferred to the
  background pass that runs a moment later.
- **Swap, never mutate.** A rebuild constructs a whole new ``Snapshot`` beside
  the live one and replaces it with a single assignment. The old snapshot keeps
  serving until that instant, so there is no window in which the server has a
  partial catalogue, and a request already in flight finishes against the
  consistent one it started with.
- **Read through the getter.** Every provider, tool and route is handed a
  ``lambda: self.snapshot...``, never a ``Catalogue``. A stored one would pin
  that component to the generation it was registered in, which is a bug that
  looks exactly like "the refresh does not work".

This server hosts Agent Skills: instruction packages that teach you how to \

one is the only operation there is.

Work down the address space, cheapest first. Listing gives you indexes -- one \
per library (`skill://grafana/_index.md`), one per top-level folder of a \
library (`skill://grafana/grafana-lgtm/_index.md`). Reading an index gives you \
what is directly in it, as URIs: its folders' indexes, and its skills. \
Reading a skill's URI (`skill://grafana/grafana-lgtm/loki/SKILL.md`) gives you \
the instructions to follow.

A skill may ship supporting files. Read `_manifest` in place of `SKILL.md` to \
list them, then read one by its path under the same skill. A library may also \
ship files outside its skills, listed at `skill://<library>/_files.md`; a path \
a skill cites that is not inside the skill is usually one of those. Do not \
read files you have no use for -- a skill citing one is not a reason to fetch \
it. Only files are read: a library, a folder or a skill's own directory serves \
nothing.
