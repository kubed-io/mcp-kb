"""The MCP server itself: wiring, and the lifecycle of what it serves.

Assembles a FastMCP instance from the catalogue a config file describes -- the
address space, the resources, the mirror tools, the routes -- and runs it on a
transport. Turning a config source into a directory is ``sources``'s job;
deciding what in it counts as a skill, a prompt or a pack-level file is
``catalogue/harvest.py``'s; building one immutable view of all of it is
``catalogue/snapshot.py``'s; the catalogue itself lives in
``catalogue/skills.py``, ``mcp/prompts.py`` and ``catalogue/uris.py``; and
deciding when a source is looked at again is ``catalogue/refresh.py``'s. This
module walks the config in source order, connects the pieces, and owns the
one mutable thing in the process: which ``Snapshot`` is current.

Three rules follow from that, and every change here has to keep them:

- **Start from the index, not from the sources.** ``<cache>/index.json`` holds
  what each source yielded last time. If it was built from this same config,
  boot reuses every record whose tree is still on disk and rebuilds only the
  rest. A pod restart is then milliseconds and touches no network, and the
  question "has anything changed?" is deferred to the background pass that runs
  a moment later.
- **Swap, never mutate.** A rebuild constructs a whole new ``Snapshot`` beside
  the live one and replaces it with a single assignment. The old snapshot keeps
  serving until that instant, so there is no window in which the server has a
  partial catalogue, and a request already in flight finishes against the
  consistent one it started with.
- **Read through the getter.** Every provider, tool and route is handed a
  ``lambda: self.snapshot...``, never a ``Catalogue``. A stored one would pin
  that component to the generation it was registered in, which is a bug that
  looks exactly like "the refresh does not work".
