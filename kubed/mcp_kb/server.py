"""The MCP server itself: wiring, and the lifecycle of what it serves.

Assembles a FastMCP instance from the catalogue a config file describes -- the
address space, the resources, the mirror tools, the routes -- and runs it on a
transport. Turning a config source into a directory is ``sources``'s job;
deciding what in it counts as a skill, a prompt or a pack-level file is
``harvest.py``'s; building one immutable view of all of it is ``snapshot.py``'s;
the catalogue itself lives in ``skills.py``, ``prompts.py`` and ``uris.py``.
This module walks the config in source order, connects the pieces, and owns the
one mutable thing in the process: which ``Snapshot`` is current.

Three rules follow from that, and every change here has to keep them:

- **Start from the index, not from the sources.** ``<cache>/index.json`` holds
  what each source yielded last time. If it was built from this same config,
  boot reuses every record whose tree is still on disk and rebuilds only the
  rest. A pod restart is then milliseconds and touches no network, and the
  question "has anything changed?" is deferred to the background pass that runs
  a moment later.
- **Swap, never mutate.** A rebuild constructs a whole new ``Snapshot`` beside
  the live one and replaces it with a single assignment. The old snapshot keeps
  serving until that instant, so there is no window in which the server has a
  partial catalogue, and a request already in flight finishes against the
  consistent one it started with.
- **Read through the getter.** Every provider, tool and route is handed a
  ``lambda: self.snapshot...``, never a ``Catalogue``. A stored one would pin
  that component to the generation it was registered in, which is a bug that
  looks exactly like "the refresh does not work".

class AnnounceChanges(Middleware):
    """Tell each session, once, that the catalogue it listed has been rebuilt.

    MCP has no "the server changed" broadcast a stateless HTTP deployment can
    rely on, so this rides the next request the client makes anyway: compare the
    generation it was last told about against the live one, and if they differ,
    send the two list-changed notifications before answering.

    Once per move, per session, which is what the stored state buys. Sending on
    every request would have every client re-listing constantly; sending only on
    a listing would leave a client that never lists again holding stale URIs.

    A session's first request stores the current generation without announcing
    anything -- it has nothing stale to discard.

    Which leaves the connections that cannot remember. MCP 2026-07-28 dropped
    sessions, and FastMCP 4.0.3 serves such a connection by minting a fresh
    session id per request: ``set_state`` there writes an entry nobody will
    ever read, one per request, into a store with a day-long TTL. So an HTTP
    request arriving without an ``mcp-session-id`` is left alone entirely --
    correct as well as cheap, since a client with no session across requests
    has no listing to invalidate. stdio and in-memory connections have no such
    header to check at all, so ``_can_remember`` defaults to True for them and
    they fall through to the state calls too -- which, under FastMCP 4.0.3,
    turn out to be just as wasted, since those transports mint a fresh state
    key per request as well. Wasted, not wrong: the calls are still guarded,
    so this must never turn a working request into a failed one.
