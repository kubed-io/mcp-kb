"""``cache: live``: bringing one file up to date with its server as it is read.

A mirrored source is copied into the cache and read from disk, which is why a
request touches no network at all. That is the right trade for a git repository
and the wrong one for a folder somebody is editing: a note changed in Nextcloud
should be readable now, not after the next refresh.

So a source may say ``cache: live``, and then the read path goes through here
first. Given the path it is about to serve, the revalidator finds the live
source that owns it, asks the server what that one file's ETag is, and fetches
it only if the ETag moved. One PROPFIND, and on a change one GET -- not the
folder, not the index, one file.

Three properties this has to keep, and they are why it is ~80 lines rather than
a cache library:

- **It degrades to the copy on disk, cheaply.** Every failure is logged and
  swallowed. A server that is down, a password that was rotated, a proxy that
  is confused: none of them may turn a read that a complete local copy could
  have answered into a read that fails. Nor may they make it *slow* -- a read
  holds the event loop, so a Nextcloud that accepts connections and never
  answers would otherwise cost the whole server a timeout per read. Hence the
  explicit client timeout and the cooldown below: the first read that times
  out is the only one that pays for it.
- **It is per-file, so it cannot see a new one.** A file that did not exist when
  the folder was indexed has no URI, and nothing asks to read it. New and
  deleted files are a ``refresh:`` interval's job, or ``POST /reindex``.
- **It belongs to its snapshot.** A refresh exports the folder to a *new*
  directory, so the roots in here are the previous generation's the moment one
  finishes. ``build_snapshot`` builds a revalidator alongside the snapshot that
  uses it, and the old one is dropped with the old snapshot.

fsspec ships ``filecache``, which is the obvious alternative and does not fit:
it stores files under hashed names in a directory of its own, and everything
downstream of a source here is a real directory tree of ``Path``s.
