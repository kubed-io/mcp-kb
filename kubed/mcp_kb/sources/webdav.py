"""``webdav+https://`` and ``webdav+http://`` -- a WebDAV folder, Nextcloud above all.

The configured URL *is* the folder, so it is the client's base and every path
under it is relative. The folder is copied into ``<cache>/src/<name>/<version>``
and everything downstream sees a plain directory, exactly as a ``file://``
source hands it one: nothing about WebDAV, the cache or the server's address
reaches a URI, a listing row or a resource body.

Three things this module is careful about:

- **The version is the ETag set.** One recursive PROPFIND prices the whole
  folder, and the digest of ``{path: etag}`` is what names the export. That
  makes "has it moved" and "what do I call the copy" the same question asked
  once: a folder that has not changed resolves to the export already on disk
  and is not downloaded again, and one that has changed is copied *beside* the
  tree being served rather than over it (``export.py``, shared with git).
- **A credential is a reference until the client exists.** The password is
  resolved from the environment into the httpx auth pair inside ``client`` and
  nowhere else. It is never part of the URL -- ``SourceBase`` refuses one that
  is -- so nothing that lands under the cache, in a log line or in the errors
  ``/health`` publishes can carry it. An HTTP failure is reported as its status
  and nothing more.
- **A live read replaces one file, atomically.** ``fetch_file`` is the other
  half of ``cache: live``: one PROPFIND, and only if the ETag moved, one GET
  into a temporary file in ``.work/`` beside the export that is then renamed
  over the local copy. A reader holding the old file reads the old file to its
  end, and a download that is killed half way through leaves nothing inside
  the export for the next pass to read as a missing file.

Read-only throughout: a source is copied from and never written to.
