"""One immutable view of the whole catalogue, and how to build one.

Everything the request path touches -- the index, the pack resources, the
address space, the prompts -- hangs off a single frozen ``Snapshot``. A rebuild
constructs a new one beside the old and the server swaps it in with one
assignment, so a listing in flight is served by a consistent catalogue and no
reader ever sees a half-rebuilt one. Nothing here mutates a snapshot; there is
no method that could.

The unit of work is a *source*. ``build_source`` does the expensive part
(materialise, harvest, parse frontmatter, hash the tree) and hands back a
``SourceRecord`` -- rows, not objects, because that record is also what gets
written to ``index.json``. ``build_snapshot`` does the cheap part: turn the
records of every source into the live objects the catalogue needs. That split
is what lets a refresh rebuild one source and reuse the rest, and what lets a
cold start rebuild *nothing* and still serve.

A failed source is a record, not an exception. One unreachable directory must
not empty the catalogue of everything else, so the failure rides in
``status`` and ``/health`` reports it.

And a source that failed *after* it once succeeded is not a failed source at
all: ``stale`` keeps the last good record, rows and root intact, and hangs the
error off it. Only a source that has never been harvested has nothing better to
serve than its error.
