"""Plain HTTP endpoints served alongside the MCP transport.

Operational, not agent-facing: these answer "what is this pod running?" for a
kubelet probe or a human with curl, and are deliberately outside the MCP
protocol so checking them needs no MCP client.

``/health`` and ``/reindex`` read the knowledge base's current snapshot when
they are called, not one captured at registration, so what they report is
what the server is serving right now. ``/openapi.yaml`` describes those two
routes and is the one built once, at registration -- see ``spec/builder.py``.
