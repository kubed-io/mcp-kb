Operational, not agent-facing: these answer "what is this pod running?" for a
kubelet probe or a human with curl, and are deliberately outside the MCP
protocol so checking them needs no MCP client.

Both routes read the knowledge base's current snapshot when they are called, not one
captured at registration, so what they report is what the server is serving
right now.
