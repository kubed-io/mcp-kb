    Served in place, so there is no clone or cache state to key off -- ``cache``
    is accepted only to keep the same signature every backend's fingerprint
    shares. Walked with ``os.walk`` (no globs), skipping hidden directories
    except the conventional agent-tooling ones, same as ``harvest.files``.

    Only regular files count, and a symlink counts only when it lands *inside*
    the root -- the same rule ``harvest.files`` applies, and the two must agree.
    Following one that escapes would fold a file elsewhere on the disk, its size
    and its mtime, into this source's fingerprint, so an unrelated edit would
    rebuild this source; refusing them all instead makes a Kubernetes ConfigMap
    mount, which is *entirely* symlinks, fingerprint as empty and therefore
    never look changed however often it is updated. ``os.walk`` still declines
    to descend a symlinked directory.
