"""``git+https://``, ``git+http://``, ``git+file://`` and ``github://``.

A git source is a repository read at a ref. It is cloned once -- bare, and
shallow wherever the transport allows one -- into ``<cache>/git/<name>``, the
ref is resolved to a commit, and that commit's tree is exported into
``<cache>/src/<name>/<commit>``. Everything downstream sees a plain directory,
exactly as a ``file://`` source hands it one; nothing about the clone, the
cache or the word "git" reaches a URI, a listing row or a resource body.

Three things this module is careful about, each for a reason:

- **A pinned commit never touches the network to fingerprint.** A 40-hex ref
  cannot move, so there is nothing to ask. A branch, a tag or a default HEAD
  costs exactly one ``list_heads`` against the remote per check -- the cheapest
  question git has, and far cheaper than a fetch.
- **An export is never written where one is being served.** Each commit gets
  its own directory, built under a dot-prefixed sibling and renamed on in one
  step. A refresh therefore adds a tree rather than replacing one, so a
  snapshot built against the old export goes on reading it for as long as a
  request is in flight, and a crash can only leave an unreferenced work
  directory. That mechanism is ``export.py``'s and is shared with every other
  backend that copies a tree into the cache; here a version is a commit.
- **A token is a reference, never a value on disk.** Credentials are resolved
  from the environment into ``RemoteCallbacks`` at the moment of the call. The
  URL saved as the clone's remote is the one from the config -- which
  ``GitSource`` refuses to accept with a credential embedded in it -- so
  nothing that lands under the cache, in a log line or in an error carries the
  secret.

One backend-visible difference worth knowing: a symlink in a repository is
exported as a regular file holding the link's target as its text, because
fsspec's ``GitFileSystem`` does not recreate links. It escapes nothing, but the
same tree behind ``file://`` is harvested with the link resolved and then
excluded by the containment guard, so the two backends serve it differently.

Read-only throughout: a source is fetched from and never pushed to, and the
working copy that would let anything write back is never created.
