# The image is the wheel plus an example config — nothing is fetched at build
# time. A source is read at container START, into the cache volume; see
# examples/config.yaml for the `github://` sources the example points at, and
# README.md for the scheme reference.
#
# Two stages, and the thing that passes between them is a VIRTUALENV.
#
# A venv inside a container looks like ceremony — the container is already an
# isolated box with one Python and one project in it. It is not here for
# isolation. It is here for RELOCATION: it makes the whole installed program one
# directory with a layout that does not depend on how the base image's Python
# was packaged, so `COPY --from` can move it in a single instruction.
#
# That is what removes the duplicate install this build used to do. `builder`
# installed the runtime dependencies in order to build a wheel that does not
# need them, and then `runner` installed them ALL OVER AGAIN out of that wheel —
# fastmcp's tree twice, and the second time on arm64 under emulation. Copying
# the venv means the runner installs nothing at all.
#
# Dependencies are installed before the source, so that layer is keyed on
# pyproject.toml rather than on every commit. .git is in the build context
# because setuptools_scm needs it, so `COPY . .` in front of the install
# invalidated the dependency layer even for a docs-only push.
#
# The layer cache that makes the ordering pay off is `type=gha`, configured in
# kubed-io/actions' build-image, which image.yml already calls. It had never
# worked when buildx was run from a plain shell step — the runner does not hand
# one ACTIONS_RUNTIME_TOKEN — and that is fixed in the action, so this repo gets
# the cache it had been configuring all along.
ARG PY_VERSION=3.14

# ---- builder: the FAT image, because nothing in it ships.
#      python:${PY_VERSION} already carries git — which setuptools_scm needs to
#      resolve the version — and a toolchain for any dependency without a wheel
#      for the target architecture. Using -slim here would mean an apt-get to
#      put git back.
