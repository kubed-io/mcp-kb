"""``webdav+…`` sources: copy the folder, key it by its ETags, revalidate a file.

Every test runs against a real WebDAV server on a loopback port that refuses an
unauthenticated request (``tests/webdav_server.py``), so the credentials are
under test rather than assumed. No test here needs the network.

The server's ETag is ``inode-mtime-size``, which is why a test that edits a file
changes its length: two bodies of the same size written in the same second are
one ETag to wsgidav. Nextcloud's are content-derived and have no such quirk.
