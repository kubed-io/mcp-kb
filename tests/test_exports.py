"""``export.py`` on its own: the rules every backend's copy into the cache keeps.

The backends' own suites prove that a git tree and a WebDAV folder come out
right. What is proved here is the part that is neither of those — that
publishing an export is one rename onto a name nothing holds, that a delete
leaves the version-named space before it starts removing files, and that the
staging directory a live read writes through is swept but never yanked out from
under a fetch in flight.

Each of these is a *property*, and each of them survived the suite as a mutant
before this file existed.
