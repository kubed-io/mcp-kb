"""What ships in the image, what rebuilds it, and what the build must not redo.

Two questions asked from opposite ends, and they drift apart quietly.

*What rebuilds the image* is `image.yml`'s `paths:` filter; *what is in the
image* is the Dockerfile's COPY lines and the wheel — and what is in the wheel
is the `packages` list, which setuptools takes literally and which a test that
only reads it back cannot check. A file that the Dockerfile
copies but the filter does not watch changes the image and builds nothing —
`:latest` then silently keeps serving the old build. `scripts/requirements.py`
is exactly that shape: it is not in the wheel, but it decides which
dependencies the venv gets.

The rest pins the build's *shape*, because the venv hand-off is an optimisation
and an optimisation with no test is a thing someone helpfully undoes. The
expensive mistake it replaced — the runner reinstalling every dependency out of
the wheel the builder had just built — reads as perfectly ordinary Dockerfile.
