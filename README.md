# mcp-kb

A resource and prompt catalogue for MCP. Serves [Agent Skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills)
and prompts over MCP, so any client can discover and read them — including clients that only
speak tools.

The image bakes nothing. A source is a dependency, declared in a config file and
fetched at container start — see `examples/config.yaml`, the four packs this
image used to bake, now read straight from GitHub:

```
docker run -p 8000:8000 -v mcp-kb-cache:/var/cache/mcp-kb \
  -v $PWD/examples/config.yaml:/etc/mcp-kb/config.yaml:ro \
  kubed/mcp-kb:latest
```

## One address space

Everything this server serves is a `skill://` URI, and reading one is the only
operation there is:

```
skill://<pack>                      an index: every skill in a pack
skill://<group>                     an index: every skill in a group
skill://<pack>/<skill>              that skill's instructions
skill://<pack>/<skill>/_manifest    what else it ships
skill://<pack>/<skill>/<path>       one of those files
skill://<pack>/_files               files the pack ships outside its skills
skill://<pack>/<path>               one of those
```

One segment is an index, two or more is content. That is the whole grammar.

Progressive disclosure lives in the address space rather than in a tool list, so the
listing stays small no matter how many skills are installed:

```
list                                  →  12 indexes, ~1.9 KB
read skill://grafana-lgtm             →  6 skills, as URIs
read skill://grafana/loki             →  the instructions to follow
```

Currently served: **90 skills** across four packs.

## Resources first, tools as a mirror

MCP has a primitive for material an agent reads, and it is the resource. So resources
are the interface, and a client that speaks them sees **no tools at all**.

Many clients only implement tools — n8n's MCP Client Tool is one — and to those a
resource-only server looks empty. They get the same interface as two tools:

| tool | mirrors |
| --- | --- |
| `list_resources()` | `resources/list` — the same `uri`/`name`/`description`/`mimeType` rows |
| `read_resource(uri)` | `resources/read` — the same URI |
| `list_prompts()` | `prompts/list` — each prompt's name, description and arguments |
| `get_prompt(name, arguments)` | `prompts/get` — the rendered, role-tagged messages |

Each pair is turned on separately, because a client may have one feature and not the
other — `?resources=off`, `?prompts=off`, or both, on the MCP URL (or the
`X-MCP-Resources` / `X-MCP-Prompts` headers):

```
http://mcp-kb.flow.svc.cluster.local:8000/mcp?resources=off&prompts=off
```

The tools are hidden from clients that have the real feature, because advertising both
shapes is two ways to ask one question. They stay callable either way.

## Choosing a library, or tags

A client can be narrowed to part of the catalogue, and the narrowing is a ceiling the
model cannot widen past — enforced on resources, prompts and every mirror tool:

| on the MCP URL | header | sees |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `?library=grafana` | `X-Skill-Library` | that whole library, or one of its groups |
| `?tags=ops,ui` | `X-Skill-Tags` | anything carrying **any** of the tags, across libraries |
| `?library=grafana&tags=ops` | both | the tagged part of that one library |

A header beats the URL. `X-Skill-Pack` still works as an alias for `X-Skill-Library`.
Set it once in the client's connection config — in n8n, a Header Auth credential on the
MCP Client Tool node, a plumbed constant rather than something the model fills in.

A deployment that should serve less gets a config that lists less.

## Prompts

A prompt is a template a person picks and fills in before the model sees anything —
Claude Code lists them as slash commands. A source serves them like anything
else it ships: `prompts/**/*.md` by convention, or an explicit `include.prompts`
glob, named `<pack>_<file-stem>`.

Each is YAML frontmatter declaring its arguments, then a body with `{{ placeholders }}`:

```markdown
---
description: Debug a workload's recent logs in Loki with the Grafana MCP server.
arguments:
- name: app
  required: true
- name: since
  default: 1h
---
Investigate the logs of **{{ app }}** over the last {{ since }}.
```

Double braces, because prompt bodies are full of LogQL and JSON. A library or tag
scope applies to prompts exactly as to skills, and a library holding only prompts is
still selectable by name.

## Sources

A source is a dependency, declared like one in the config file:

```yaml
sources:
- name: superpowers
  url: github://obra/superpowers
  ref: b36e0829c6d0140e93cfef2ca599b1b07d4a7797
  include:
    skills: ["skills/*/SKILL.md"]
```

| scheme | backend |
| --- | --- |
| `file://` | a directory on this machine, served in place — must be absolute (`file:///path`) |
| `git+https://`, `git+http://`, `git+file://` | a git remote, cloned bare and shallow |
| `github://org/repo` | shorthand for `git+https://github.com/org/repo.git` |
| `webdav+https://`, `webdav+http://` | a WebDAV folder — Nextcloud above all — copied into the cache |

`ref` is a branch, tag or commit; pin a commit and an image is reproducible, leave
it unset and the source tracks the remote's default branch. `subdirectory` narrows
the harvest to a path within the clone — the shipped example reaches the same
effect with `include` globs like `skills/*/SKILL.md` instead, without setting one.
`auth` supplies HTTP Basic credentials for a private remote as `{username, password:
{env: NAME}}` — GitHub wants `x-access-token` and a `GITHUB_TOKEN`-style PAT. The
username takes an `{env:}` reference too, for the common case where a service
account's name is issued alongside its password and repeating it here is how the
two drift apart. It is
the only way in: a URL carrying its own `user:token@` is refused, because git saves
a remote URL to disk verbatim and the URL is quoted back in what `/health` reports.

One difference between the backends worth knowing: a symlink in a git repository is
served as a regular file holding the link's target as its text. Behind `file://` a
symlink is followed when it lands inside the source root — which is what makes a
Kubernetes ConfigMap mount, all symlinks, servable — and left out when it escapes.

A pack that factors shared material up out of its skills — penpot references `shared/*`
from 190 places — adds those directories to `include.files`, and they are served at
`skill://<pack>/<path>` alongside the skills that cite them.

A git source is cloned once and re-exported on its `refresh` interval (`30s`, `5m`,
`1h`); left unset, it is read once at boot and only rebuilt on restart.

### A WebDAV folder, and `cache: live`

The URL *is* the folder, so a Nextcloud share is the path you see in its web UI
under `remote.php/dav/files/<user>/`. `auth` is required — WebDAV has no useful
anonymous mode — and the password is an `{env:}` reference to a Nextcloud **app
password**, never the account's own:

```yaml
- name: notes
  url: webdav+https://cloud.example.com/remote.php/dav/files/drk/Skills
  auth:
    username: {env: NEXTCLOUD_USER}      # or the literal name
    password: {env: NEXTCLOUD_PASSWORD}
  cache: live
  refresh: 5m
  include:
    skills: ["*/SKILL.md"]
```

`cache` is the dial. `snapshot`, the default, is every other mirrored source: the
folder is copied at index time and read from disk thereafter, so a request touches
no network at all. `cache: live` keeps that copy and revalidates a file as it is
read — one PROPFIND for its ETag, and a download only if the ETag moved. **A file
edited in Nextcloud is served on the next read**, with no refresh and no restart.

What live mode does *not* do is notice a **new** file. One that did not exist when
the folder was indexed has no URI, so nothing ever asks to read it — and the same
goes for a renamed or deleted one. Nor does it refresh a skill's **description**:
listing rows come from the harvest, so an edited description appears when the
source is rebuilt. That is what `refresh: 5m` above is for, and `POST /reindex`
forces it now. Live mode is for the bodies of the files that are already there.

A server that stops answering is not an outage: a revalidation that fails is logged
and the read is served from the copy on disk. A server that has gone *quiet* rather
than refused — accepting connections and never replying — costs one read a bounded
timeout, and that source is then left unrevalidated for half a minute, so the reads
behind it come straight off disk. `/health` marks such a source `cooling`, and it
comes back by itself as soon as the server answers again.

One caveat if the folder is not Nextcloud's. Revalidation is only as sharp as the
server's ETag — Nextcloud derives one from the content, but a server that derives it
from mtime and size can miss an edit that changed neither, and one that sends no
ETag at all falls back to exactly that pair. `cache: snapshot` plus a `refresh`
interval is the honest setting there.

## Configuration

| variable | default | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CONFIG` | `/etc/mcp-kb/config.yaml` | config file listing the sources to serve |
| `CACHE_DIR` | `/var/cache/mcp-kb` | directory a non-`file://` source materialises into |
| `TRANSPORT` | `http` | `http` or `stdio` |
| `HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | bind address |
| `PORT` | `8000` | port |

See `examples/config.yaml` for what the image ships, and `config.schema.json` — a
plain `Config.model_json_schema()` — for the full shape of a source.

Per request: `?resources=off` and `?prompts=off` reveal the tool mirrors, `?library=`
and `?tags=` narrow what is served, and `?skills=full` enumerates every skill in the
listing (for clients that sync skills to disk).

`GET /health` reports status, the libraries and skill/prompt counts, and each
configured source's own status.

## Index and refresh

`CACHE_DIR/index.json` is the on-disk catalogue: what each source yielded last
time, rows enough to rebuild every skill and prompt without re-reading a
single file. Cold start reads it and serves in milliseconds; a background pass
then checks each source's fingerprint and rebuilds only the ones that moved,
so a pod restart never has to re-harvest a source that has not changed.

`refresh: 5m` on a source schedules that check; a source with none is never
revisited on its own:

```yaml
- name: superpowers-tip
  url: github://obra/superpowers
  ref: main
  refresh: 5m
```

`POST /reindex` forces a rebuild of every source immediately, fingerprint
check skipped, and answers with `/health`'s body plus `rebuilt`, the source
names actually rebuilt this pass — since the fingerprint check is skipped,
that is every source that did not fail identically to how it already had,
changed or not, not only the ones whose content moved.

A session that persists across requests is told, once, the next time it asks
— MCP 2026-07-28 has no sessions of its own, so a sessionless client gets no
such notice and instead relies on `cache_ttl`, which this server advertises as
the shortest `refresh` among its sources.

## Deploying

The image is the whole artifact: point `CONFIG` at a config file and `CACHE_DIR` at a
writable volume, and it serves whatever the config names. Kubernetes manifests, node
placement and everything else about running this somewhere are the installer's
concern — this repo ships none of its own.

`CACHE_DIR` has to be writable by uid **65534**, which the container runs as. A Docker
named volume inherits the directory's ownership and needs nothing; a Kubernetes
`emptyDir` or PVC mounts root-owned, so the pod needs `securityContext.fsGroup: 65534`.
Without it the server logs that it cannot write `index.json` and re-harvests every
source on every restart.
