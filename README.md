# 📚 mcp-kb

**An MCP knowledge base.** Skills, prompts and agent material collected from git, WebDAV and folders into one catalogue, served as resources — or as tools, for clients without them. 🗂️

## The whole idea, in one breath

Your [Agent Skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) and prompts are scattered — a repo on GitHub, a folder somebody edits in Nextcloud, a ConfigMap in the cluster. Name them in one config file and every agent reads them from one address space, over MCP.

```
sources (git · WebDAV · folders)  ──▶  mcp-kb  ──▶  agents (resources, or tools)
```

**The image bakes nothing.** A source is a dependency — a URL, an optional pinned commit, and a credential that is a *reference* to an environment variable rather than a value — fetched at container start into a cache volume. 🪄

---

## 🔤 One address space

Everything served is a `skill://` URI, and reading one is the only operation there is.

```
skill://<library>                     an index: every skill in it
skill://<library>/<skill>             that skill's instructions
skill://<library>/<skill>/_manifest   what else it ships
skill://<library>/<skill>/<path>      one of those files
skill://<library>/_files              what the library ships outside its skills
```

**One segment is an index, two or more is content.** That is the whole grammar. Progressive disclosure lives in those addresses rather than in a tool list, so a listing is a dozen index rows whether the catalogue holds nine skills or ninety.

## 🪞 Resources first, tools as a mirror

MCP already has a primitive for material an agent reads, and it is the **resource**. So resources are the interface, and a client that speaks them sees *no tools at all*.

Many clients only implement tools — n8n's MCP Client Tool above all — and to those a resource-only server looks empty. They get the same interface as four tools, revealed with `?resources=off`, `?prompts=off`, or both:

| Tool | Mirrors |
|---|---|
| `list_resources()` | `resources/list` — the same `uri`/`name`/`description` rows |
| `read_resource(uri)` | `resources/read` — the same URI |
| `list_prompts()` | `prompts/list` — each prompt's name, description and arguments |
| `get_prompt(name, arguments)` | `prompts/get` — the rendered, role-tagged messages |

The vocabulary is the protocol's own, so an agent that can drive MCP resources can drive these with nothing new to learn. Each pair is hidden from a client that has the real feature, and stays callable either way.

## 🎯 One server, many narrow agents

A client can be given part of the catalogue and no more, and the narrowing is a **ceiling the model cannot widen past** — enforced on resources, prompts and every mirror tool alike:

| On the MCP URL | Header | Sees |
|---|---|---|
| `?library=grafana` | `X-Skill-Library` | that whole library, or one of its groups |
| `?tags=ops,ui` | `X-Skill-Tags` | anything carrying **any** of the tags, across libraries |
| `?library=grafana&tags=ops` | both | the tagged part of that one library |

A header beats the URL, which is what makes a scope pinned inside a credential something the caller cannot edit away. It is a plumbed constant, never a tool argument — there is no way for a model to ask for material it was not given.

## 🔌 Sources

A source is a dependency, declared like one:

```yaml
sources:
- name: superpowers
  url: github://obra/superpowers
  ref: b36e0829c6d0140e93cfef2ca599b1b07d4a7797
  include:
    skills: ["skills/*"]
    prompts: []
```

| Scheme | Backend |
|---|---|
| `file:///path` | a directory on this machine, served in place — ConfigMap mounts included |
| `github://org/repo`, `git+https://`, `git+http://`, `git+file://` | a git remote, cloned bare and shallow and exported at a commit |
| `webdav+https://`, `webdav+http://` | a WebDAV folder — Nextcloud above all — copied into the cache |

Pin a `ref` and the image serves the same bytes in a year; track a branch and give it a `refresh:` and something goes and looks. `cache: live` on a WebDAV source revalidates a file by ETag as it is read, so **a file edited in Nextcloud is served on the next read**. A credential is always an `{env: NAME}` reference — a URL carrying its own `user:token@` is refused.

## 💬 Prompts

A skill is read by the model when it decides to. A **prompt** is picked by a person, who fills in a few arguments first — Claude Code lists them as slash commands. YAML frontmatter declares the arguments, the body carries `{{ placeholders }}`, and the same libraries, tags and scopes apply:

```markdown
---
description: Debug a workload's recent logs in Loki with the Grafana MCP server.
arguments:
- name: app
  required: true
- name: since
  default: 1h
---
Investigate the logs of **{{ app }}** over the last {{ since }}.
```

Double braces, because prompt bodies here are full of LogQL and JSON.

## 🚀 Running it

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
  -v mcp-kb-cache:/var/cache/mcp-kb \
  -v "$PWD/examples/config.yaml:/etc/mcp-kb/config.yaml:ro" \
  kubed/mcp-kb:latest
```

Two mounts and that is the deployment. `examples/config.yaml` serves four pinned GitHub packs out of the box. Then point an MCP client at `http://localhost:8000/mcp`.

The cache wants to be writable by uid **65534**, which the container runs as: a named Docker volume needs nothing, a Kubernetes `emptyDir` needs `fsGroup: 65534`.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Every flag has an environment fallback: containers are configured with env vars, developers reach for flags. These say **how** to run; the config file says **what** to serve.

| Env | Flag | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CONFIG` | `--config` | `/etc/mcp-kb/config.yaml` | The config file listing the sources to serve |
| `CACHE_DIR` | `--cache-dir` | `/var/cache/mcp-kb` | Where a non-`file://` source materialises, and where `index.json` lives |
| `TRANSPORT` | `--transport` | `http` | `http` or `stdio` |
| `HOST` | `--host` | `0.0.0.0` | Bind address, http only |
| `PORT` | `--port` | `8000` | Port, http only |

Per request, on the MCP URL — each with a header form that beats it:

| Parameter | Header | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `?resources=off` | `X-MCP-Resources` | Reveals the resource mirror tools |
| `?prompts=off` | `X-MCP-Prompts` | Reveals the prompt mirror tools |
| `?library=<name>` | `X-Skill-Library` (alias `X-Skill-Pack`) | Restricts this client to one library or group |
| `?tags=a,b` | `X-Skill-Tags` | Restricts it to anything carrying any of those tags |
| `?skills=full` | `X-Skill-Listing` | Lists every skill, for clients that sync them to disk |

`mcp-kb schema` prints the config JSON Schema, which is also committed as `config.schema.json` for an editor to validate against live.

## 🩺 Operations

`GET /health` reports the generation being served, the libraries, the skill and prompt counts, and each source's own status — `ok`, `stale` or `failed`. It needs no credentials and answers 200 whenever the process is serving, *including* when a source failed to load: one unreachable remote must not take a working catalogue down.

`POST /reindex` rebuilds every source now and answers with the same body plus what it rebuilt. `GET /openapi.yaml` is the machine-readable contract for both.
